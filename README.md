Smart Bin: IoT-Based Garbage Monitoring System

Description
    Smart Bin is an IoT-based garbage monitoring system designed to optimize waste management by providing real-time updates on bin status. This system leverages sensors and IoT technology 
    to monitor waste levels and notify authorities when bins need to be emptied.

Key Features:
    Ultrasonic Sensor: Measures the garbage level inside the bin.
    NodeMCU (ESP8266/ESP32): Sends real-time data to the cloud.
    Cloud Integration: Data is stored and visualized using platforms like Firebase, ThingSpeak, or MQTT.
    Mobile/Web Dashboard: Provides real-time monitoring and alerts.
    Automated Notifications: Sends alerts to waste management teams when bins are full.
    Low Power Consumption: Efficient and cost-effective solution.

How It Works:
    The ultrasonic sensor detects the waste level in the bin.
    The microcontroller processes the data and transmits it to the cloud.
    The dashboard visualizes the bin status, and alerts are triggered if the bin reaches a threshold.
    Authorities receive notifications for timely waste collection.
    This smart waste management solution helps reduce overflowing bins, optimize collection routes, and contribute to a cleaner environment.
